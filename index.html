        <h2> History </h2>
        <p> During the XIX and XX Century coffee and railroads expanded together. It was so relevant that coffee plantation regions were named after the railroads that passed by them. The railroad of Paulista Railways Company formed the region of Marília. Therefore it was, and still is known as Paulista Region.</p>
        <p>Santa Maria Farm’s first owner was Mr. Bento de Abreu Sampaio Vidal. Born in Campinas (São Paulo State) he became State Deputy and founder of the city of Marília. ​Bento de Abreu was a highly regarded person for the region, even nowadays, neighboring residents know the property by the alias "Santa Maria do Abreu" in reference to its first owner.</p>
        <p> In the second half of the 1920s, Bento de Abreu had already transferred his estates as an inheritance to his descendants. Santa Maria Farm felt upon Paulo de Abreu Sampaio Vidal (whose initials can be found engraved on the property that houses the granary and coffee-sorting machine). Jose Francisco Malta, Mr. Abreu ́s grandson, bought the property and managed the farm throughout his life with outstanding​ ​care.</p>
        <p>In the year of 2013, Mr. Luiz Alberto Guimarães Alvim acquired Santa Maria farm. Currently the Alvim family runs the property with the collaboration​ ​of​ ​some​ ​families​ ​of​ ​employees​ ​who have been working there for many years, since the Malta​ ​Family. </p>
        <p>The first map of the property dates back to 1924, and in the building for the storage and the benefit of coffee we can find the end of construction date, 1928. The houses of the farm colony follow the architecture of the railroad employees ́ houses. It is undoubtedly one of the oldest properties in the region, bearing in itself traces of the technological evolution of coffee production, the transition from manual labor and large colonies to​ ​mechanization. </p>
        <p> Although the prop​erty have always produced coffee, today no coffee trees remain from the first crops of Bento and Paulo de Abreu, cultivated with sharecroppers and settlers. The great frost of 1975 and the emergence and infestation of root-knot-nematodes in the soil (pest that attacks the root of coffee plants) throughout the 1980s and 1990s forced the renewal of the coffee plantations. Francisco Malta renewed part of the coffee trees in aligned plantations, adequate for mechanization, with use of grafting for resistance to nematodes. The Alvim family followed the modern planting of the coffee, seeking productivity increase, reduction​ ​of​ ​costs​ ​and​ ​higher​ ​quality.</p>

          <h2>Production​ ​and​ ​postharvest</h2>
          <p>Currently the property has more than 300 acres of coffee, employing around 15 workers and more extra 10 to 15 during the harvest season. Fields are cultivated in full sun, without irrigation, ​processed by natural method​ ​with​ ​mixed​ ​drying​ ​(in​ ​the​ ​sun​ ​and​ ​in​ ​mechanical​ ​dryers).</p>
          <p>The varieties planted are ​Novo Mundo​, ​Obatã​, ​Ouro Verde​, ​Icatu​, ​Catuaí and ​IBC 125​, all developed by the​ ​Agronomic​ ​Institute​ ​(IAC)​ ​in​ ​Campinas,​ ​São​ ​Paulo​ ​State.</p>
